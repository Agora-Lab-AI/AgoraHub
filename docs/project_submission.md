# Proposal Title

A proposal by project instigator 1, project instigator 2, etc.

## Abstract

Provide brief outline motivating the project. How would it positively impact biological research? What is the hypothesis behind it? No need to discuss datasets or models  yet, we will do that later. Focus on the grand picture and \textit{why} the community should care about it.

## Introduction and Prior Work

Provide a short (preferably beginner friendly) introduction to the project and a brief outline of the literature most relevant to it. How does the project fit into this context?

## Deliverables

What do we plan to provide the broader community with upon the completion of the project? Datasets? Models? APIs? Every deliverable should preferably have its own subsection with its associated potential impact, although it is not required.

### Datasets

If applicable, how large is the dataset that the project aims to produce? How difficult is producing such a dataset expected to be? What kind of resources are needed? What license will the dataset be licensed under? MIT is preferred but not required.


### Models

If applicable, does the project aim to release more than one model? What would be the input modality? What about the output modality? How large are the models that the project aims to release? Are there other important differences between the models to be released? If the models are very different, consider writing a short subsection for each model type.

### APIs

If applicable, what kind of API does the project aim to release? Are there any existing APIs that it could be integrated into? What kind of documentation could the project provide?

### Paper

Can the project be turned into a paper? What does the evaluation process for such a paper look like? What conferences are we targeting? Can we release a blog post as well as the paper?

## Resources

### Requirements

What kinds of resources (e.g. GPU hours, RAM, storage) are needed to complete the project?

### Timeline

What is a (rough) timeline for this project?

## Broader Impact

How is the project expected to positively impact biological research at large?

## Reproducibility

What steps are going to be taken to ensure the project's reproducibility? Will data processing scripts be released? What about training logs?

## Failure Case

If our findings are unsatisfactory, do we have an exit plan? Do we have deliverables along the way that we can still provide the community with?

## Preliminary Findings

If applicable, mention any preliminary findings (e.g. experiments you have run on your own or heard about) that support the project's importance.

## Next Steps

If the project is successfully completed, are there any obvious next steps?

## Known contributors

Please list community members that you know are interested in contributing. It is best if a project proposal already has an associated team capable of going ahead with the project by themselves, but it is not necessary.
