# Introduction

Agora is a collective of AI Engineers and creators advancing humanity through artificial intelligence. 

#### Our Guiding Principles:
* **Humanity First:** Our research has 1 definitive purpose... To advance Humanity above all else.
* **Open Source:** From start to finish every project we work on is completely open source even if it does not work yet, our devotion to radical openness faciliates accelerated learning.
* **High-Impact:** All of our research is high impact, we focus on projects that can improve the quality of life for millions of human beings through multi-modal, continual, and collective learning!

#### Research Priorities:
* üåê **Multi-modal Approach:** Utilizing AI to process and reason with multiple forms of data.
* üíß **Adaptability:** Models that are as fluid as water, capable of being fine-tuned and trained in real-time.
* üå≤ **Reasoning:** Our work aims to achieve superintelligence as swiftly as possible. To this end, we strive to augment models' reasoning capabilities through innovative prompting techniques like the Tree of Thoughts or Forest of Thoughts.
* **Collective Intelligence** Scaling up collaboration between agents to accomplish real-world tasks.

Our ultimate goal is to foster the development of superintelligent AI that can reason across modalities, tasks, and environments and can collaborate with other AI's!

Now, how can you contribute?
