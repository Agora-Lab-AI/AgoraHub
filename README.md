Agora is a collective of AI Engineers and creators advancing humanity through artificial intelligence. 

Our research revolves around these guiding principles:

* 🌐 **Multi-modal Approach:** Utilizing AI to process and reason with multiple forms of data.
* 💧 **Adaptability:** Models that are as fluid as water, capable of being fine-tuned and trained in real-time.
* 🌲 **Reasoning:** Our work aims to achieve superintelligence as swiftly as possible. To this end, we strive to augment models' reasoning capabilities through innovative prompting techniques like the Tree of Thoughts or Forest of Thoughts.
* **Collective Intelligence** Scaling up collaboration between agents to accomplish real-world tasks.

Our ultimate goal is to foster the development of superintelligent AI that can reason across modalities, tasks, and environments and collaborate with other AI's!

# 🎇 Our Projects

We're currently working on various paper implemenentations and made-in-house frameworks. The majority are on [Kye's github](https://github.com/kyegomez) and [Agora's Github](https://github.com/Agora-X):

- **[Andromeda 🌌](https://github.com/kyegomez/Andromeda)**
Andromeda is an ultra-fast foundation language model capable of processing inputs greater than 100,000+ tokens. It's a stepping stone towards realizing our vision of AI with enhanced reasoning abilities.

- **[Kosmos-X 🌕](https://github.com/kyegomez/Kosmos-X)**
Kosmos-X is a multi-modality foundation model that can process vision, audio, images, and more. By combining different modalities, Kosmos-X represents a leap towards more comprehensive and interconnected AI systems.

- **[Palm-E](https://github.com/kyegomez/PALM-E)**
PALM-E is a SOTA Multi-Modality Foundation model that can understand text, images, and robotic sequences and execute intelligent multi-modal tasks in the real-world!

- **[Swarms 🪐](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms)**
Swarms facilitates the creation of swarms of AI agents, opening new possibilities for distributed AI tasks, crowd-based learning, and explorations of emergent behaviors.

- **[Zeta](https://github.com/kyegomez/zeta)**
Zeta enables you to Build high-performance AI models with modular building blocks!
