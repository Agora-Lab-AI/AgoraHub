## üéá Our Projects

We're currently working on various paper implemenentations and made-in-house frameworks. The majority are on [Kye's github](https://github.com/kyegomez) and [Agora's Github](https://github.com/Agora-X):

- **[Andromeda üåå](https://github.com/kyegomez/Andromeda)**
Andromeda is an ultra-fast foundation language model capable of processing inputs greater than 100,000+ tokens. It's a stepping stone towards realizing our vision of AI with enhanced reasoning abilities.

- **[Kosmos-X üåï](https://github.com/kyegomez/Kosmos-X)**
Kosmos-X is a multi-modality foundation model that can process vision, audio, images, and more. By combining different modalities, Kosmos-X represents a leap towards more comprehensive and interconnected AI systems.

- **[Palm-E](https://github.com/kyegomez/PALM-E)**
PALM-E is a SOTA Multi-Modality Foundation model that can understand text, images, and robotic sequences and execute intelligent multi-modal tasks in the real-world!

- **[Swarms ü™ê](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms)**
Swarms facilitates the creation of swarms of AI agents, opening new possibilities for distributed AI tasks, crowd-based learning, and explorations of emergent behaviors.

- **[Zeta](https://github.com/kyegomez/zeta)**
Zeta enables you to Build high-performance AI models with modular building blocks!
